3. Remarks

- For detailed information, please see Epson ePOS SDK for iOS User's Manual.

- Under TCP/IP connection at iOS9.x, set the default gateway address to the
  network router.

- When printing process is repeated, create and destroy the instance of Printer class
  outside the iteration process and do not repeat it at short intervals.

- Call addTextLang API in first on each print data.

4. Restriction

- Discovery function of the following TM Intelligent printer doesn't support.

    TM-DT series (TM-DT software version 3.01 or earlier)

  If you turn on the TM Intelligent printer after starting the search, the TM Intelligent
  printer may not be detected. In that case, leave enough time for the TM Intelligent printer
  to become printable, then start the search again.
